The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. 
Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming a defaulter.

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the
applicant’s profile.

Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
